--><body><p>A 30&#215;30 grid of squares contains 900 fleas, initially one flea per square.<br>
When a bell is rung, each flea jumps to an adjacent square at random (usually 4 possibilities, except for fleas on the edge of the grid or at the corners).</p>

<p>What is the expected number of unoccupied squares after 50 rings of the bell? Give your answer rounded to six decimal places.</p>
