--><body><p>Let ABCD be a convex quadrilateral, with diagonals AC and BD. At each vertex the diagonal makes an angle with each of the two sides, creating eight corner angles.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="project/images/a9099cf7__p177_quad.gif" class="dark_img" alt=""></p>
<p>For example, at vertex A, the two angles are CAD, CAB.</p>
<p>We call such a quadrilateral for which all eight corner angles have integer values when measured in degrees an "integer angled quadrilateral". An example of an integer angled quadrilateral is a square, where all eight corner angles are 45&#176;. Another example is given by DAC = 20&#176;, BAC = 60&#176;, ABD = 50&#176;, CBD = 30&#176;, BCA = 40&#176;, DCA = 30&#176;, CDB = 80&#176;, ADB = 50&#176;.</p>
<p>What is the total number of non-similar integer angled quadrilaterals?</p>
<p>Note: In your calculations you may assume that a calculated angle is integral if it is within a tolerance of 10<sup>-9</sup> of an integer value.</p>
