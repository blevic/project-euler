8 5 <span class="red"><b>9</b></span> 3</p>
<p>That is, 3 + 7 + 4 + 9 = 23.</p>

<p class="smaller"><b>NOTE:</b> This is a much more difficult version of <a href="./4ad1e18d__problem.html">Problem 18</a>. It is not possible to try every route to solve this problem, as there are 2<sup>99</sup> altogether! If you could check one trillion (10<sup>12</sup>) routes every second it would take over twenty billion years to check them all. There is an efficient algorithm to solve it. ;o)</p>
