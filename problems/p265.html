--><body><p>2<sup>N</sup> binary digits can be placed in a circle so that all the N-digit clockwise subsequences are distinct.</p>

<p>For N=3, two such circular arrangements are possible, ignoring rotations:</p>
<div align="center"><img src="project/images/a241358c__p265_BinaryCircles.gif" class="dark_img" alt="p265_BinaryCircles.gif"></div>

<p>For the first arrangement, the 3-digit subsequences, in clockwise order, are:<br> 000, 001, 010, 101, 011, 111, 110 and 100.</p>

<p>Each circular arrangement can be encoded as a number by concatenating the binary digits starting with the subsequence of all zeros as the most significant bits and proceeding clockwise. The two arrangements for N=3 are thus represented as 23 and 29:
</p><div align="center">00010111&#8201;<sub>2</sub> = 23</div>
<div align="center">00011101&#8201;<sub>2</sub> = 29</div>

<p>Calling S(N) the sum of the unique numeric representations, we can see that S(3) = 23 + 29 = 52.</p>

<p>Find S(5).</p>
