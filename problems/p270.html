--><body><p>A square piece of paper with integer dimensions N&#215;N is placed with a corner at the origin and two of its sides along the <var>x</var>- and <var>y</var>-axes. Then, we cut it up respecting the following rules:
</p><ul><li>We only make straight cuts between two points lying on different sides of the square, and having integer coordinates.</li>
<li>Two cuts cannot cross, but several cuts can meet at the same border point.</li>
<li>Proceed until no more legal cuts can be made.</li>
</ul><p>Counting any reflections or rotations as distinct, we call C(N) the number of ways to cut an N&#215;N square. For example, C(1)&#8201;=&#8201;2 and C(2)&#8201;=&#8201;30 (shown below).</p>
