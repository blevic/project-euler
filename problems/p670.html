--><body><p>A certain type of tile comes in three different sizes - 1&#215;1, 1&#215;2, and 1&#215;3 - and in four different colours: blue, green, red and yellow. There is an unlimited number of tiles available in each combination of size and colour.</p>

<p>These are used to tile a $2\times n$ rectangle, where $n$ is a positive integer, subject to the following conditions:</p>
<ul><li>The rectangle must be fully covered by non-overlapping tiles.</li>
<li>It is <i>not</i> permitted for four tiles to have their corners meeting at a single point.</li>
<li>Adjacent tiles must be of different colours.</li>
</ul><p>For example, the following is an acceptable tiling of a $2\times 12$ rectangle:</p>

<div class="center">
<img src="project/images/6ebd1a76__p670_strip_acceptable.png" alt="Acceptable colouring"></div>

<p>but the following is not an acceptable tiling, because it violates the "no four corners meeting at a point" rule:</p>

<div class="center">
<img src="project/images/99f7dd3b__p670_strip_unacceptable.png" alt="Unacceptable colouring"></div>

<p>Let $F(n)$ be the number of ways the $2\times n$ rectangle can be tiled subject to these rules. Where reflecting horizontally or vertically would give a different tiling, these tilings are to be counted separately.</p>

<p>For example, $F(2) = 120$, $F(5) = 45876$, and $F(100)\equiv 53275818 \pmod{1\,000\,004\,321}$.</p>
<p>Find $F(10^{16}) \bmod 1\,000\,004\,321$.</p>
