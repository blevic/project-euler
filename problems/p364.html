There are <var>N</var> seats in a row. <var>N</var> people come after each other to fill the seats according to the following rules:
</p><ol type="1"><li>If there is any seat whose adjacent seat(s) are not occupied take such a seat.</li>
<li>If there is no such seat and there is any seat for which only one adjacent seat is occupied take such a seat.</li>
<li>Otherwise take one of the remaining available seats. </li>
</ol>
Let T(<var>N</var>) be the number of possibilities that <var>N</var> seats are occupied by <var>N</var> people with the given rules.<br> The following figure shows T(4)=8.

<p>We can verify that T(10) = 61632 and T(1 000) mod 100 000 007 = 47255094.</p>
<p>Find T(1 000 000) mod 100 000 007.</p>
