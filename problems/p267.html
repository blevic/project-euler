--><body><p>You are given a unique investment opportunity.</p>
<p>Starting with &#163;1 of capital, you can choose a fixed proportion, <var>f</var>, of your capital to bet on a fair coin toss repeatedly for 1000 tosses.</p>
<p>Your return is double your bet for heads and you lose your bet for tails.</p>
<p>For example, if <var>f</var>&#8201;=&#8201;1/4,  for the first toss you bet &#163;0.25, and if heads comes up you win &#163;0.5 and so then have &#163;1.5. You then bet &#163;0.375 and if the second toss is tails, you have &#163;1.125.</p>
<p>Choosing <var>f</var> to maximize your chances of having at least &#163;1,000,000,000 after 1,000 flips, what is the chance that you become a billionaire?</p>
<p>All computations are assumed to be exact (no rounding), but give your answer rounded to 12 digits behind the decimal point in the form 0.abcdefghijkl.</p>
