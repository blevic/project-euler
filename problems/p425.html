Two positive numbers A and B are said to be <i>connected</i> (denoted by "A &#8596; B") if one of these conditions holds:<br>
(1) A and B have the same length and differ in exactly one digit; for example, 123 &#8596; 173.<br>
(2) Adding one digit to the left of A (or B) makes B (or A); for example, 23 &#8596; 223 and 123 &#8596; 23.
</p>
<p>
We call a prime P a <i>2's relative</i> if there exists a chain of connected primes between 2 and P and no prime in the chain exceeds P.
</p>
<p>
For example, 127 is a 2's relative. One of the possible chains is shown below:<br>
2 &#8596; 3 &#8596; 13 &#8596; 113 &#8596; 103 &#8596; 107 &#8596; 127<br>
However, 11 and 103 are not 2's relatives.
</p>
<p>
Let F(N) be the sum of the primes &#8804; N which are not 2's relatives.<br>
We can verify that F(10<sup>3</sup>) = 431 and F(10<sup>4</sup>) = 78728.
</p>
<p>
Find F(10<sup>7</sup>).
