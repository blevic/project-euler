--><body><p>Take the number 6 and multiply it by each of 1273 and 9854:</p>

<p class="margin_left">6 &#215; 1273 =  7638<br>
6 &#215; 9854 = 59124</p>

<p>By concatenating these products we get the 1 to 9 pandigital 763859124. We will call 763859124 the "concatenated product of 6 and (1273,9854)". Notice too, that the concatenation of the input numbers, 612739854, is also 1 to 9 pandigital.</p>

<p>The same can be done for 0 to 9 pandigital numbers.</p>

<p>What is the largest 0 to 9 pandigital 10-digit concatenated product of an integer with two or more other integers, such that the concatenation of the input numbers is also a 0 to 9 pandigital 10-digit number?</p>
