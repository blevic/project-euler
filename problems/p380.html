An m&#215;n maze is an m&#215;n rectangular grid with walls placed between grid cells such that there is exactly one path from the top-left square to any other square. <br>The following are examples of a 9&#215;12 maze and a 15&#215;20 maze:

<p>
Let C(m,n) be the number of distinct m&#215;n mazes. Mazes which can be formed by rotation and reflection from another maze are considered distinct.
</p>
<p>
It can be verified that C(1,1) = 1, C(2,2) = 4, C(3,4) = 2415, and C(9,12) = 2.5720e46 (in scientific notation rounded to 5 significant digits).<br>
Find C(100,500) and write your answer in scientific notation rounded to 5 significant digits.
</p>
<p>
When giving your answer, use a lowercase e to separate mantissa and exponent.
E.g. if the answer is 1234567891011 then the answer format would be 1.2346e12.
