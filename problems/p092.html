--><body><p>A number chain is created by continuously adding the square of the digits in a number to form a new number until it has been seen before.</p>
<p>For example,</p>
<p class="margin_left">44 &#8594; 32 &#8594; 13 &#8594; 10 &#8594; <b>1</b> &#8594; <b>1</b><br>
85 &#8594; <b>89</b> &#8594; 145 &#8594; 42 &#8594; 20 &#8594; 4 &#8594; 16 &#8594; 37 &#8594; 58 &#8594; <b>89</b></p>
<p>Therefore any chain that arrives at 1 or 89 will become stuck in an endless loop. What is most amazing is that EVERY starting number will eventually arrive at 1 or 89.</p>
<p>How many starting numbers below ten million will arrive at 89?</p>
