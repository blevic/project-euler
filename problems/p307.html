<var>k</var> defects are randomly distributed amongst <var>n</var> integrated-circuit chips produced by a factory (any number of defects may be found on a chip and each defect is independent of the other defects).
</p>
<p>
Let p(<var>k,n</var>) represent the probability that there is a chip with at least 3 defects.<br>
For instance p(3,7) &#8776; 0.0204081633.
</p>
<p>
Find p(20 000, 1 000 000) and give your answer rounded to 10 decimal places in the form 0.abcdefghij
