--><body><p>Gauss famously proved that every positive integer can be expressed as the sum of three <b>triangular numbers</b> (including 0 as the lowest triangular number).  In fact most numbers can be expressed as a sum of three triangular numbers in several ways.</p>
<p>
Let $G(n)$ be the number of ways of expressing $n$ as the sum of three triangular numbers, regarding different arrangements of the terms of the sum as distinct.</p>
<p>
For example, $G(9) = 7$, as 9 can be expressed as:  3+3+3, 0+3+6, 0+6+3, 3+0+6, 3+6+0, 6+0+3, 6+3+0.<br>  
You are given $G(1000) = 78$ and $G(10^6) = 2106$.</p>
<p>
Find $G(17 526 \times 10^9)$.</p>
