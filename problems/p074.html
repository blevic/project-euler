--><body><p>The number 145 is well known for the property that the sum of the factorial of its digits is equal to 145:</p>
<p class="margin_left">1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145</p>
<p>Perhaps less well known is 169, in that it produces the longest chain of numbers that link back to 169; it turns out that there are only three such loops that exist:</p>
<p class="margin_left">169 &#8594; 363601 &#8594; 1454 &#8594; 169<br>
871 &#8594; 45361 &#8594; 871<br>
872 &#8594; 45362 &#8594; 872</p>
<p>It is not difficult to prove that EVERY starting number will eventually get stuck in a loop. For example,</p>
<p class="margin_left">69 &#8594; 363600 &#8594; 1454 &#8594; 169 &#8594; 363601 (&#8594; 1454)<br>
78 &#8594; 45360 &#8594; 871 &#8594; 45361 (&#8594; 871)<br>
540 &#8594; 145 (&#8594; 145)</p>
<p>Starting with 69 produces a chain of five non-repeating terms, but the longest non-repeating chain with a starting number below one million is sixty terms.</p>
<p>How many chains, with a starting number below one million, contain exactly sixty non-repeating terms?</p>
