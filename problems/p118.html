--><body><p>Using all of the digits 1 through 9 and concatenating them freely to form decimal integers, different sets can be formed. Interestingly with the set {2,5,47,89,631}, all of the elements belonging to it are prime.</p>
<p>How many distinct sets containing each of the digits one through nine exactly once contain only prime elements?</p>
