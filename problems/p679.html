--><body><p>Let $S$ be the set consisting of the four letters $\{\texttt{`A'},\texttt{`E'},\texttt{`F'},\texttt{`R'}\}$.<br>
For $n\ge 0$, let $S^*(n)$ denote the set of words of length $n$ consisting of letters belonging to $S$.<br>
We designate the words $\texttt{FREE}, \texttt{FARE}, \texttt{AREA}, \texttt{REEF}$ as <i>keywords</i>.</p>

<p>Let $f(n)$ be the number of words in $S^*(n)$ that contains all four keywords exactly once.</p>

<p>This first happens for $n=9$, and indeed there is a unique 9 lettered word that contain each of the keywords once: $\texttt{FREEFAREA}$<br>
So, $f(9)=1$.</p>

<p>You are also given that $f(15)=72863$.</p>

<p>Find $f(30)$.</p>
