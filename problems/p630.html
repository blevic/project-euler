Given a set, $L$, of unique lines, let $M(L)$ be the number of lines in the set and let $S(L)$ be the sum over every line of the number of times that line is crossed by another line in the set.  For example, two sets of three lines are shown below:
</p>
<div align="center"><img src="project/images/a859aea6__p630_threelines.png" alt="crossed lines"></div>
<p>
In both cases M(L) is 3 and S(L) is 6: each of the three lines is crossed by two other lines.  Note that even if the lines cross at a single point, all of the separate crossings of lines are counted.
</p>
<p>
Consider points ($T_{2k&#8722;1}$,&#8201;$T_{2k}$), for integer $k&#8201;&gt;= 1$, generated in the following way:
</p>
<p>
$S_0 	=  	290797$<br> 
$S_{n+1} 	=  	{S_n}^2 \:\: \rm{mod} \:\: 50515093$<br>
$T_n 	=  	(&#8201;S_n \:\: \rm{mod} \:\: 2000&#8201;) &#8722; 1000$
</p>
<p>
For example, the first three points are: (527,&#8201;144), (&#8722;488,&#8201;732), (&#8722;454,&#8201;&#8722;947).  Given the first $n$ points generated in this manner, let $L_n$ be the set of <b>unique</b> lines that can be formed by joining each point with every other point, the lines being extended indefinitely in both directions.  We can then define $M(L_n)$ and $S(L_n)$ as described above.
</p>
<p>
For example, $M(L_3) = 3$ and $S(L_3) = 6$.  Also $M(L_{100}) = 4948$ and $S(L_{100}) = 24477690$.
</p><p>
Find $S(L_{2500})$.
