--><body><p>A 4x4 grid is filled with digits d, 0 &#8804; d &#8804; 9.</p>

<p>It can be seen that in the grid</p>

<p class="center">
6 3 3 0<br>
5 0 4 3<br>
0 7 1 4<br>
1 2 4 5</p>

<p>the sum of each row and each column has the value 12. Moreover the sum of each diagonal is also 12.</p>

<p>In how many ways can you fill a 4x4 grid with the digits d, 0 &#8804; d &#8804; 9 so that each row, each column, and both diagonals have the same sum?</p>
