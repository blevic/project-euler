A <b>Pythagorean triple</b> consists of three positive integers $a, b$ and $c$ satisfying $a^2+b^2=c^2$.<br>
The triple is called primitive if $a, b$ and $c$ are relatively prime.<br>
Let P($n$) be the number of <b>primitive Pythagorean triples</b> with $a &lt; b &lt; c \le n$.<br>
For example P(20) = 3, since there are three triples: (3,4,5), (5,12,13) and (8,15,17).
</p>
<p>
You are given that P(10<sup>6</sup>) = 159139.<br>
Find P(3141592653589793).
