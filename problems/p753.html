--><body><p>Fermat's Last Theorem states that no three positive integers $a$, $b$, $c$ satisfy the equation 
$$a^n+b^n=c^n$$
for any integer value of $n$ greater than 2.</p>

<p>For this problem we are only considering the case $n=3$. For certain values of $p$, it is possible to solve the congruence equation:
$$a^3+b^3 \equiv c^3 \pmod{p}$$</p>

<p>For a prime $p$, we define $F(p)$ as the number of integer solutions to this equation for $1 \le a,b,c &lt; p$.</p>

<p>You are given $F(5) = 12$ and $F(7) = 0$.</p>

<p>Find the sum of $F(p)$ over all primes $p$ less than $6\,000\,000$.</p>
