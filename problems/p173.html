--><body><p>We shall define a square lamina to be a square outline with a square "hole" so that the shape possesses vertical and horizontal symmetry. For example, using exactly thirty-two square tiles we can form two different square laminae:</p>
<div class="center">
<img src="project/images/64057c49__p173_square_laminas.gif" alt=""></div>
<p>With one-hundred tiles, and not necessarily using all of the tiles at one time, it is possible to form forty-one different square laminae.</p>
<p>Using up to one million tiles how many different square laminae can be formed?</p>
