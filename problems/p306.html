--><body><p>The following game is a classic example of Combinatorial Game Theory:</p>

<p>Two players start with a strip of $n$ white squares and they take alternate turns.<br>
On each turn, a player picks two contiguous white squares and paints them black.<br>
The first player who cannot make a move loses.</p>

<ul><li>$n = 1$: No valid moves, so the first player loses automatically.</li>
<li>$n = 2$: Only one valid move, after which the second player loses.</li>
<li>$n = 3$: Two valid moves, but both leave a situation where the second player loses.</li>
<li>$n = 4$: Three valid moves for the first player, who is able to win the game by painting the two middle squares.</li>
<li>$n = 5$: Four valid moves for the first player (shown below in red), but no matter what the player does, the second player (blue) wins.</li>
</ul><div class="center"><img src="project/images/1240ec66__p306_pstrip.gif" class="dark_img" alt="p306_pstrip.gif"></div>

<p>So, for $1 \le n \le 5$, there are 3 values of $n$ for which the first player can force a win.<br>
Similarly, for $1 \le n \le 50$, there are 40 values of $n$ for which the first player can force a win.</p>

<p>For $1 \le n \le 1 000 000$, how many values of $n$ are there for which the first player can force a win?</p>
