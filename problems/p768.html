--><body><p>A certain type of chandelier contains a circular ring of $n$ evenly spaced candleholders.<br>
If only one candle is fitted, then the chandelier will be imbalanced. However, if a second identical candle is placed in the opposite candleholder (assuming $n$ is even) then perfect balance will be achieved and the chandelier will hang level.</p>

<p>Let $f(n,m)$ be the number of ways of arranging $m$ identical candles in distinct sockets of a chandelier with $n$ candleholders such that the chandelier is perfectly balanced.</p>

<p>For example, $f(4, 2) = 2$: assuming the chandelier's four candleholders are aligned with the compass points, the two valid arrangements are "North &amp; South" and "East &amp; West". Note that these are considered to be different arrangements even though they are related by rotation.</p>

<p>You are given that $f(12,4) = 15$ and $f(36, 6) = 876$.</p>

<p>Find $f(360, 20)$.</p>
