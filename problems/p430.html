--><body><p><var>N</var> disks are placed in a row, indexed 1 to <var>N</var> from left to right.<br>
Each disk has a black side and white side. Initially all disks show their white side.</p>

<p>At each turn, two, not necessarily distinct, integers <var>A</var> and <var>B</var> between 1 and <var>N</var> (inclusive) are chosen uniformly at random.<br>
All disks with an index from <var>A</var> to <var>B</var> (inclusive) are flipped.</p>

<p>The following example shows the case <var>N</var> = 8. At the first turn <var>A</var> = 5 and <var>B</var> = 2, and at the second turn <var>A</var> = 4 and <var>B</var> = 6.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="project/images/25dbbd71__p430_flips.gif" class="dark_img" alt="p430_flips.gif"></p>

<p>Let E(<var>N</var>, <var>M</var>) be the expected number of disks that show their white side after <var>M</var> turns.<br>
We can verify that E(3, 1) = 10/9, E(3, 2) = 5/3, E(10, 4) &#8776; 5.157 and E(100, 10) &#8776; 51.893.</p>

<p>Find E(10<sup>10</sup>, 4000).<br>
Give your answer rounded to 2 decimal places behind the decimal point.</p>
