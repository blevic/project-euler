--><body><p>In  the hexadecimal number system numbers are represented using 16 different digits:</p>
<div class="center">0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F</div>
<p>The hexadecimal number AF when written in the decimal number system equals 10x16+15=175.</p>
<p>In the 3-digit hexadecimal numbers 10A, 1A0, A10, and A01 the digits 0,1 and A are all present.<br>
Like numbers written in base ten we write hexadecimal numbers without leading zeroes.</p>
<p>How many hexadecimal numbers containing at most sixteen hexadecimal digits exist with all of the digits 0,1, and A present at least once?<br>
Give your answer as a hexadecimal number.</p>
<p>(A,B,C,D,E and F in upper case, without any leading or trailing code that marks the number as hexadecimal and without leading zeroes , e.g. 1A3F and not: 1a3f and not 0x1a3f and not $1A3F and not #1A3F and not 0000001A3F)</p>
