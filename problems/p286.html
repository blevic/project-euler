--><body><p>Barbara is a mathematician and a basketball player. She has found that the probability of scoring a point when shooting from a distance <var>x</var> is exactly (1&#8201;-&#160;<sup><var>x</var></sup>/<sub><var>q</var></sub>), where <var>q</var> is a real constant greater than 50.</p>

<p>During each practice run, she takes shots from distances <var>x</var>&#8201;=&#8201;1, <var>x</var>&#8201;=&#8201;2, ..., <var>x</var>&#8201;=&#8201;50 and, according to her records, she has precisely a 2&#8201;% chance to score a total of exactly 20 points.</p>

<p>Find <var>q</var> and give your answer rounded to 10 decimal places.</p>
