--><body><p>Consider the isosceles triangle with base length, $b = 16$, and legs, $L = 17$.</p>
<div class="center">
<img src="project/images/34b57fba__p138.png" width="230" height="228" class="dark_img" alt=""></div>
<p>By using the Pythagorean theorem it can be seen that the height of the triangle, $h = \sqrt{17^2 - 8^2} = 15$, which is one less than the base length.</p>
<p>With $b = 272$ and $L = 305$, we get $h = 273$, which is one more than the base length, and this is the second smallest isosceles triangle with the property that $h = b \pm 1$.</p>
<p>Find $\sum L$ for the twelve smallest isosceles triangles for which $h = b \pm 1$ and $b$, $L$ are positive integers.</p>
